# Performance-Testing using Apache JMeter.

## Introduction

This performance test was conducted on the website [https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com](https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com) to evaluate its behavior under varying levels of concurrent API requests. The test aimed to assess the system's stability, throughput, and its ability to handle high traffic loads efficiently. 

Using **Apache JMeter**, the test simulated concurrent user threads, starting from 100 and increasing to 5000, with a ramp-up period of 10 seconds for each test. Key performance metrics such as **Average Transactions Per Second (TPS)** and the total number of API requests successfully processed were recorded to identify potential bottlenecks and measure the system's performance under different load conditions. 

The results provide insights into the system's capacity to handle concurrent users and will help guide optimizations for future scalability and performance improvements.


## Prerequisites

Before conducting performance tests using Apache JMeter, ensure that the following prerequisites are met:

1. **Apache JMeter**
   - Minimum version: **Apache JMeter 4.0**
   - Download the latest version from the [Apache JMeter website](https://jmeter.apache.org/download_jmeter.cgi).

2. **Java Development Kit (JDK)**
   - Ensure that **Java 8** or higher is installed on your system. 
   - You can download the JDK from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk8-downloads.html) or [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/install/).
   - Verify the installation by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
     ```bash
     java -version
     ```

3. **System Requirements**
   - A machine with sufficient CPU and memory resources to handle the expected load during testing.
   - Ensure that your system meets the minimum requirements for running JMeter effectively.
   - We suggest multicore CPUs with 4 or more cores.
   - Memory 16GB RAM is a good value.

## Test execution

* JMeter should be initialized in non-GUI mode.
* Run Command Prompt from jmeter\bin folder.

### Run Test and Generate Logs: 
```bash
  jmeter -n -t RestfulBooker_TC100.jmx    -l RestfulBooker_TC100.jtl
```      
  - **n**: non GUI mode
  - **t**: test plan to execute
  - **l**: output file with results

Then continue to upgrade Threads(100 to 5000) by keeping Ramp-up Same.     

After completing this command  

### Make html file
```bash
  jmeter -g report\RestfulBooker_TC100.jmx -o RestfulBooker_TC100.html
```
  - **g**: jtl results file
  - **o**: path to output folder

### Key Observations

1. **Stable Performance**
   - The system performed stably up to **4500 concurrent requests**. The Average TPS steadily increased with the number of concurrent requests, reaching up to **302 TPS** with 4000 concurrent requests.

2. **4500 Concurrent Requests**
   - With **4500 concurrent requests**, the system remained stable but the throughput decreased. The Average TPS was **209**, lower than the expected progression from previous tests. This indicates the system could handle the load, but with reduced efficiency.

3. **Performance Degradation at 5000 Concurrent Requests**
   - When the number of concurrent requests reached **5000**, performance dropped significantly. The Average TPS increased to **336**, but errors were noticed during execution, indicating that the system struggled to handle this level of concurrency.

### Conclusion

The system demonstrated solid performance up to **4500 concurrent requests**, handling high traffic efficiently but with reduced throughput at this level. Beyond this threshold, particularly at **5000 concurrent requests**, errors emerged, suggesting a need for optimization or infrastructure scaling to maintain performance under extreme load conditions.

---

### Recommendations

1. **System Tuning**
   - Investigate potential bottlenecks in the system (e.g., database connections, server limits) and tune them to handle more than 4500 concurrent users. Special attention should be paid to throughput optimization for **4500 concurrent requests**.

2. **Infrastructure Scaling**
   - Consider scaling the infrastructure vertically or horizontally to accommodate higher concurrency levels.

3. **Further Testing**
   - Conduct additional testing at a range between **4500 and 5000** concurrent requests to pinpoint the systemâ€™s capacity limit more accurately.
